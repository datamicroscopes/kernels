there one new yorker who doesn compare the collapse the world trade center disaster movie james sanders had kind hideousness specificity that filmic scene never has said sanders architect urban historian and the author celluloid skyline new york and the movies knopf published last month sanders has spent more than decade studying how filmmakers bring the city life and occasionally topple and his book concludes that not only does the look and feel new york inspire the movies but that audiences everywhere also learn how new yorkers from the movies how for instance drink martini the thin man fall love dance floor swing time have romantic dinner the roof kate and leopold and admire the skyline almost any woody allen film course even the best hollywood movies sometimes overstate the city charms for one thing filmmakers tend give their new york characters typically muddled romantics looking for fame love possibly work impossibly lavish apartments but sanders willing cut the movies some slack this area why asks new yorkers scoff the size tom hanks soho loft big while accepting the idea that year old boy can occupy man body and for those who believe that meg ryan apartment when harry met sally was lot nicer than that most journalists points out case you hadn noticed meg ryan also prettier than most people there tendency overdo everything the movies said sanders who also wrote the seven part pbs series new york documentary film with ric burns them because they are larger than life even find that filmmakers are pretty thoughtful about the way apartment used and what says about

what time for promotion richard parsons chief operating officer aol time warner will not become the company chief executive until may but already acting has job and already apparent that the job will even harder than many media professionals would have expected when his promotion was announced barely more than month ago have theory life things never get easier they only get harder parsons said wednesday think the current environment makes more interesting certainly more challenging that environment includes the write off billion billion that will taken reflect some the decline the value the company since the merger america online and time warner was announced january the challenges are reflected the reduction monday the company cash flow target for range percent percent many analysts had expected percent more least two things are now clear first the advertising market remains horrid the aol internet unit will hard pressed make significant contribution cash flow growth this year fact aol time warner meets the growth target the stars will probably its cable television systems and its film studio units that appeared stodgy just few years ago second even the cable television and film units have stellar years the company will still probably have cut hundreds millions dollars costs meet even its lowered expectations for now the most important financial yardstick for aol time warner and most other media companies remains cash flow measured earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda accounting the company had already completed its pending acquisitions bertelsmann percent stake aol europe and ipc european publishing company appears that when aol time warner announces results for later this month will report about billion ebitda the company generate growth the middle its projected range for this year percent then must come with about million additional cash flow where could come from since the merger the financial bedrock aol time warner has been its cable television business which has about million subscribers now that the unit broadly offering cable modem and digital television service features that can generate additional revenue appears set contribute perhaps million additional cash flow this year financially aol time warner lumps its film and television production and distribution operations into what called the filmed entertainment group perhaps the biggest problem that group that reaped around million cash flow selling syndication rights the smash hit seinfeld and friends sitcoms and has nothing comparable stature sell syndication this year that will make tougher for the unit show year over year growth still the unit poised reap bonanza from the home video and dvd releases the popular harry potter and lord the rings films the end enough people will probably want invite wizards and goblins into their homes offset the unit deficit syndication the unit could post perhaps million additional ebitda this year additional million million new cash flow could come from the company publishing operation though magazine advertising remains weak the newly acquired european ipc group which produces titles including loaded and horse amp hound appears doing fairly well but advertising weakness will make difficult for aol time warner cable television networks which include tbs and cnn avoid falloff cash flow and though the warner music group unit trying regain momentum continues struggle along with most the music industry too will well tread water where does this leave the aol internet service which was meant the company growth engine tough spot the recent collapse the unit iplanet joint venture with sun microsystems which was meant help companies expand their internet presence will take about million cash flow away from the aol division the demise iplanet will probably offset reduction losses aol europe perhaps million from about million last year yet the online advertising market anything even worse shape than traditional advertising the internet unit saving grace could that will continue add millions subscribers even aol time warner probably cannot count the unit deliver much more than million million additional cash flow altogether the numbers add about million new cash flow would surprise however see aol cut its costs perhaps million top the reduction aol europe that means total million new cash flow which would just get the company percent ebitda growth the low end its target everything top that would gravy making parsons first year the job much easier attention editors all photos

times crises one the ways that leaders can demonstrate the quality their leadership with speeches that clarify heal and point the way ahead for their followers the tragic events sept presented just such challenge president george bush and prime minister tony blair and both rose the challenge worth investigating the speeches detail see what lessons they can offer businesspeople who must also respond times crisis with both rhetoric and action praise the fallen advise the living both speeches are related the genre funeral orations the sense that they are the major public pronouncements date the tragic deaths thousands people from many nations the ancient greeks developed the genre its highest rhetorical state and they dictated that funeral orations have two major sections praise for the fallen and advice for the living bush begins with nice reference the state the union address order praise the fallen the normal course events presidents come this chamber report the state the union tonight such report needed has already been delivered the american people have seen the courage passengers who rushed terrorists save others the ground passengers like exceptional man named todd beamer blair dwelt more the pain and suffering the victims believe their memorial can and should greater than simply the punishment the guilty that out the shadow this evil should emerge lasting good destruction the machinery terrorism wherever found hope amongst all nations new beginning where seek resolve differences calm and ordered way greater understanding between nations and between faiths and above all justice and prosperity for the poor and dispossessed that people everywhere can see the chance better future through the hard work and creative power the free citizen not the violence and savagery the fanatic the action take will proportionate targeted will all humanly can avoid civilian casualties but understand what are dealing with listen the calls those passengers the planes think the children them told they were going die think the cruelty beyond our comprehension amongst the screams and the anguish the innocent those hijackers drove full throttle planes laden with fuel into buildings where tens thousands worked this very powerful speech making indeed but raises the question whether plays too strongly the suffering the victims part the point memorializing the fallen give meaning and perspective their lives that better done stressing the active legacy the fallen will leave behind rather than focusing their tragic deaths honest about the challenges ahead both speeches deserve high marks for not giving the politician perennial temptation overpromise how easy the future state will achieve leaders need find way affirm basic underlying hope difficult times without being pollyanna ish bush description the task ahead good example our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes americans should not expect one battle but lengthy campaign unlike any other have ever seen may include dramatic strikes visible and covert operations secret even success will starve terrorists funding turn them one against another drive them from place place until there refuge rest take announce some concrete action the speech presenters often forget the importance public speech announce new direction step taken the effect the audience powerful gives listeners sense that something even now being done that helps the healing process and gives people hope for the future blair had specific announcements his speech but his was address the labour party was different occasion and demanded different kind speech his job was lay out agenda for the party follow nonetheless bush gets the nod here for recalling that there nothing galvanizing actually making something happen speech bush took the opportunity provided announce new cabinet level position the office homeland security demonstrate leadership acting both personally and behalf the whole the requirement today for leaders both personal and corporate perhaps the toughest balancing act maintain have seen corporate leaders react crises bureaucratic undemonstrative

after spending years and billion studies the energy department said thursday that would recommend that yucca mountain barren volcanic structure about miles from las vegas used bury thousands tons highly radioactive nuclear waste from power plants and nuclear weapons factories the department has been trying for decades find place dispose the waste piling its bomb factories and civilian power plants and thursday decision only one step tortuous process with outcome that still uncertain but the first time that the department has said publicly that can make scientific case that the waste can secured yucca mountain the project faces substantial technical legal and political challenges and could derailed either house congress the courts engineering problems since congress chose the site prime candidate for the burial wastes nevada officials and environmental groups have questioned the ability engineers reliably predict that will not leak significantly for years government rules require the energy secretary spencer abraham added twist the debate thursday saying should consolidate the nuclear wastes enhance protection against terrorist attacks moving them one underground location that far from population centers the project expected cost more than billion president bush approves and other problems block preparation the earliest that waste could stored the mountain officials said but the suitability the site still far from clear some scientists and faces the intense opposition the nevada congressional delegation including harry reid the deputy majority leader simple majority either house could block the project although reid and john ensign the republican senator from nevada said that would difficult reid called the recommendation audacious saying scientific work not complete pointed out that the general accounting office last month said there were issues still studied before the energy department would ready apply the nuclear regulatory commission for license open repository they should just cool till they ready reid said but abraham said thursday that believed that the science behind this project sound and that the site technically suitable for this purpose but the senate majority leader tom daschle said recommendation now would unfortunate and premature ensign who has also vowed fight the project said that the energy department seemed hell bent making yucca mountain the repository matter what scientific studies showed putting the waste nevada has one advantage for the other states means the hot potato went somewhere else and there pressure from some state governments solve the problem operating power reactors around the country are running out storage space spending money extend their storage capacity while the nuclear industry not near building new reactors many plant owners are seeking year extensions their year operating permits john sununu the former white house chief staff and former governor new hampshire which was once considered for burial site and geraldine ferraro the former congresswoman from new york said joint statement that abraham decision was decisive step forward towards meeting our generation responsibility for the stewardship used nuclear fuel and defense waste sununu and ferraro are members committee assembled the chamber commerce push for the opening the yucca site abraham announcement took the form day advance notice the governor nevada required under the nuclear waste law that the department will recommend the site the president disposal nuclear waste has been festering problem for the civilian power industry for years but has drawn more attention since the sept terrorist attacks most the spent fuel stored giant steel lined pools which were intended hold only few years their reactor output but now have decades fuel they are built withstand earthquake tornado and other threats but they were drained terrorist attack experts say that they could burn and spread vast amounts radiation but the decades long argument over what with nuclear waste even the terrorist argument cuts both ways depending who providing the analysis some opponents nuclear power say that the waste not safe where power plants around the country but would even more risk trucks and trains route nevada the mayor las vegas oscar goodman said would oppose the use yucca rallying the mayors cities along the transportation routes said that there were cities with populations least those routes and million people living within half mile the routes the federal effort find place put wastes began the 1960s congress promised have repository open january and the energy department signed contracts with the reactor owners take their wastes beginning that time exchange for payment tenth cent per kilowatt hour generated nuclear power plants since then the government has collected about billion but will least before yucca could open even remains the chosen site the utilities are suing for breach contract often backed their state regulators who say ratepayers have paid for disposal but received nothing return some opponents say that driving hard yucca mountain the department may have taken years long detour down blind alley the institute for environment and energy research arjun makhijani nuclear scientist who specializes studying the energy department said that favored repository but that the chemical conditions yucca mountain were certain cause corrosion the containers and the spread radioactive materials scientists agree that the most likely way that the materials would spread leaking into the water that flows down inside the mountain and then moves underground beneath the desert fact the energy department has learned more about the characteristics the rock has placed more reliance the packaging plans develop for the waste and less the rock itself this has led opponents assert that the project longer the law requires geologic repository but man made one another problem that the department recently belatedly concluded that law firm winston amp strawn that has done much the groundwork for preparing application license the yucca site had conflict interest because was also lobbyist for the nuclear industry the time the choice survives the congress the energy department will have submit application for license the nuclear regulatory commission which must hold hearings and decide whether yucca can contain the wastes for years under rules written last year the environmental protection agency

president bush came out the west texas oil patch has deep roots the the nation oil industry now has announced that will dump clinton era billion project develop high mileage cars but wait before everyone jumps the conclusion that bush has abandoned program reduce gasoline consumption favor his buddies big oil that not the case actually bush transferring subsidies away from gasoline fueled cars into cars that will bypass gasoline pumps altogether oil gasoline bush has gone green how about that big oil transferring government subsidies away from additional studies the internal combustion engine bush has pointed the automotive industry toward future when motorists will continue enjoy the same independence and freedom movement except they will not add greenhouse gases depend upon foreign oil imports there nothing wrong with getting more fuel efficient gasoline powered cars the problem that automobile manufacturers engine builders chemical engineers and shade tree mechanics the world over have been studying perfecting modifying and experimenting with this problem since the first internal combustion engine was bolted into the first wheeled vehicle fuel injection computerized fuel and engine mapping along with expensive exotic materials can squeeze bit more efficiency out current internal combustion engines but not much mostly improved vehicle fuel efficiency comes from reducing power size and weight which involve significant trade offs safety comfort and utility rather than pour billion into effort squeeze few more miles per gallon out gasoline fueled cars bush will invest the research and development hydrogen based fuel cells power tomorrow family sedans fuel cells have been around for more than years they have been used successfully nasa space flights they work

less than year after california endured blackouts and political and economic upheaval when deregulated the power industry texas this week began its own deregulation plan with officials promising that there would reprise california chaos but consumer advocates while generally agreeing that the texas plan included better safeguards that california expressed skepticism that residential customers would benefit from long term price reductions energy providers compete for business these advocates also warned that texas like california had failed provide adequate protections ensure that the state does not suffer from electricity shortages demand increases for texas deregulation comes not long after enron corp the houston based energy giant that championed deregulated energy markets collapsed into bankruptcy meanwhile the chairman the state agency that will oversee the deregulated electricity market has come under political attack for his past ties enron the official launch deregulation texas was new year day but wednesday marked the first business day operation and yet few the million eligible households had chosen switch providers away from the long standing utilities state officials predicted that the transition would gradual particularly for residential customers many whom are still unaware that change afoot nor have electricity retailers rushed into the residential market yet new retailers have registered with the state but most are seeking commercial and industrial clients terry hadley spokesman for the texas public utility commission the agency overseeing the electricity marketplace said electricity retailers are sharpening their pencils see what kind offers they can make several companies are already marketing residential customers hadley predicted that such appeals will intensify coming months adding that officials hope see more companies come into the market will concerned see pullback from what starting out said still uncertain whether texas customers will embrace deregulation particularly after the problems california the new rules texas establish immediate retail price reduction between percent and percent drop partly attributable the low price natural gas which often used fuel electric generation plants this savings built into the price beat the state mandated price per kilowatt hour that the old utilities will allowed charge under deregulation keep their customers new retailers meanwhile will allowed offer lower prices way entice customers switch can compete with the existing price beat said marcie zlotnick spokeswoman for gexa energy new retailer that hopes sign residential customers the houston and dallas metropolitan areas years end she said her company would offer price cents per kilowatt hour versus the price beat cents another company green mountain energy austin which emphasizes wind generated power will actually charge small premium above the price beat texas officials have taken pains reassure consumers and journalists that california problems were unique california the state deregulated the wholesale power market while keeping retail prices capped this caused the state two biggest public utilities lose billions dollars when wholesale prices spiked and the retail price caps prevented them from pushing the costs along consumers one reason that wholesale prices jumped was that the price natural gas was then record high but california officials including gov gray davis also accused several energy companies including enron manipulating prices and exacerbating the state problems charge the companies denied california problems were also partly attributable lack supply the state had not built major power plant roughly decade endured rolling blackouts and other problems before federal regulators last summer ordered restraints electricity prices september the california public utilities commission voted shift away from deregulation since then states such nevada oklahoma and new mexico have postponed plans for deregulation but texas officials have expressed confidence their plan unlike california texas deregulated the wholesale electrical market providing time buffer work out any kinks before introducing retail deregulation this year and also unlike california texas has seen about power plants built the state during the past six years currently officials say the state electrical supply exceeds demand percent nor does the state plan mandate the sort retail price caps that crippled the california utilities have more than enough capacity and supply electricity hadley said and the mechanics are place make adjustments for any dramatic spike fuel costs and are going about this steady approach consumer advocates are more skeptical carol biedrzycki executive director the texas ratepayers organization save energy said the state should have required electricity providers maintain reserve margin electrical capacity roughly percent above demand she believes state officials have inflated power generating capacity and could face problems increasing demand few years order keep the prices stable have have reserve margin she said janee briesemeister senior analyst with the southwest regional office consumers union austin noted the primary selling point deregulation was that would bring lower energy prices consumers but she said group the new retailers have already sought increase the price beat effort that failed she said the relatively small number companies expressing interest the residential market could mean that state regulators may eventually have take some sort action fear that looks like there aren lot companies offering services consumers texas then their reaction will raise prices consumers she said story can end here optional material

the morning sept terrorists were hijacking four commercial airliners three the democratic party top strategists were having breakfast with small group political reporters downtown washington hotel james carville robert shrum and stan greenberg came armed with polling data suggesting that the bush administration was flailing about with little connection the everyday concerns americans the public was lukewarm toward the new president tax cuts concerned about his close ties corporate america wary his plans drill for oil pristine wilderness alaska doubtful his commitment health care and social security reforms and anxious about the downward spiral the economy but the most astounding finding was that percent believed george bush who came the oval office with frat boy underachiever reputation was over his head the country leader even his worst days with the iran hostage crisis and double digit inflation jimmy carter never had numbers approaching this level greenberg told the reporters all all the democratic strategists concluded the elections looked like good year for democrats chance for the party expand their one seat edge the senate overtake the republicans seat majority the house and with states electing governors add the statehouses controlled the party before the breakfast was over however one the hijacked planes had slammed into one the towers the world trade center new york the group was leaving the hotel word came that another plane had hit the other tower and before they got back their offices third plane had slammed into the pentagon fourth had crashed into the pennsylvania countryside and america was war the war afghanistan and the soaring popularity brought the president have created political landscape that radically different from what has gone before carville shrum and greenberg readily acknowledge now nonetheless they maintain their latest strategy memo democrats that still moment opportunity for the party long democrats focus primarily domestic issues primarily the economy the environment and health care excepting franklin roosevelt democrats party controlling the white house has picked seats first midterm election since the civil war the average loss dozen seats just what the democrats need reinforcing that historical pattern the state the economy there have been eight periods economic contraction since six the eight occurred during midterm election all with republican the white house and those elections the average number house seats lost the president party has been the gop banked offsetting the historic trends with round post census redistricting that leave house republicans with more favorable district boundaries but gains from redistricting have been offset republican retirements far compared only six democrats independent analysts say the republicans can still find hope this year complex political dynamics powerful the historical patterns appear least today things are stacking way that suggest history will not repeat itself political newsletter publisher charles cook informed his subscribers this week for instance this fall senate races also appear favor the democrats they are defending just seats compared for the gop but the democratic incumbents may more vulnerable five them won last time with percent less the vote compared only four the republicans similarly the democrats must defend only governorships this fall while the republicans have statehouses hold but the presidential election bush outperformed gore the states with gubernatorial races this year carrying percent the states with democratic governors while gore was winning percent gop controlled states even the democrats good luck may work against them this fall former republican national committee strategist john pitney now political science professor california said that last year defection sen jim jeffords vermont from the republican party costing his former party control the senate strips the democrats potent argument when one party controls the white house and both chambers congress easy for the out party blame everything the party and argue that need balance the government but with split party control congress the balance arguably there already said the end says cook the fall elections may fought remarkably level playing field with the quality candidates and the amount campaign funding playing pivotal roles consequently both parties have been raising campaign money record levels the democratic senatorial campaign committee reported this week that raised record breaking million last year its republican counterpart the national republican congressional committee has not yet made public its total but raised million the first six months last year story can end here optional add follows despite the president popularity and the accompanying rise his party standing polls since sept show the public evenly divided party identification republican pollster bill mcinturff has cautioned that the economy bush soft underside another gop pollster frank luntz also cautions that the president and his party have until labor day demonstrate the soundness their fiscal policies what needs happen said perceived recovery the economy least two months before the elections still democrats have been emboldened the election democratic governors virginia and new jersey last fall replacing republicans both states right now you have democratic governors from mississippi the east coast new jersey said from the founder and director the democratic leadership council the promoter the moderate new democrat ideology anybody had predicted that two years ago they would have been laughed democratic strategists analyzing the virginia and new jersey races have concluded that their best approach the midterm election continue their steadfast support for the president his war terrorism but challenge him and his fellow republicans host domestic issues particularly the economy for example radio commercial sponsored the democratic congressional campaign committee last month against against rep john shimkus ill preview what likely come the charged that the administration backed economic stimulus package shimkus voted for congress last year was actually attempt pass billions dollars tax breaks for huge corporations shimkus responded with his own commercial since september america has united never before unfortunately that not always the case politics now not the time for partisanship bickering rather time pull together pursue justice abroad and repair our economy here home but partisanship what fuels elections and despite the unity over the war terrorism there sign that the tone washington has changed much from elections past democrats are accusing the president worsening the recession with tax cuts that favor the wealthy republicans are accusing the democrats wanting tax and spend and the president vowing that taxes will increased over dead body the perfect storm white house budget

despite recent increases consumer confidence and other positive signs imminent economic recovery still might premature put the champagne ice while optimism good thing too much good thing can bad investors who failed heed fed chairman alan greenspan now famous admonition against irrational exuberance the stock market found out but there underlying cloud the horizon consumer debt while the zero percent interest deals the recent holiday season bolstered the automotive sector and brought shoppers out droves consumers have been spending and charging with abandon and even though the interest rate cuts initiated the federal reserve lowered interest rates for consumers only lessened the impact credit card debt and other interest bearing purchases now that the business community seems nearly ready jump the economic recovery bandwagon there good chance that consumers will the ones lagging behind they look for ways pay down their personal debt recent months banks have tightened credit for both consumer and commercial lending sign that debt burdens are rising and while consumer might not concerned lending officers are high personal debt nothing new american consumers the savings rate americans compares unfavorably those europe and elsewhere however consumers here seem more aware the problem while the tax rebate checks that people received late summer and early fall were expected boost spending and keep the nation out recession many americans used the money pay down credit card debt with the holiday season over and the nation moving into the traditional winter doldrums consumers are likely sit tight for now least until the promised economic recovery manifests itself the problem course that without strong consumer spending there will recovery speak for all the talk recovery this year one would think was foregone conclusion but like the predicted second half recovery this latest projection could disappear just quickly lot things have happen for real recovery occur and just few things going wrong could throw monkey wrench into the works for example the recent decision opec lower production levels could push energy costs significantly higher pushing prices across the board and strangling any economic growth the continuing tide layoff announcements with ford recent cutbacks only the latest example will hurt consumer confidence and give americans pause consider their own job security and the charade companies exceeding reduced earnings expectations likely wear thin investors wanting see real profit growth course the possibility another terrorist attack serious setback the war afghanistan would trump any economic recovery well certain extent theoretically possible talk ourselves out recession think the economy strong and growing will likely act and spend and plan are all the money but reality has way intruding even the most pleasant perspectives and getting that monthly credit card bill has way bringing you back reality way few things

miles fowler congregation used call him reverend but the lithonia pastor recently took another title that says fits him much better now bishop miles fowler fowler elevation bishop did not come through the traditional route election appointment church hierarchy the pastor big miller grove baptist church assumed the title himself the lord laid heart become consecrated bishop explains when last looked the scriptures did not see where the lord said should called reverend fowler part curious transformation taking place outside mainstream churches increasing number pastors are giving themselves getting their colleagues the ministry for them status enhancing titles such bishop doctor even apostle the practice particularly popular the african american church some say been sparked the tremendous popularity bishop jakes pastor whose woman thou art loosed revivals and television ministry have made him famous not that many people called themselves bishop until jakes took the title says apostle jamie pleasant the kingdom builders christian center norcross once bishop jakes got everybody wanted bishop and like jakes shrewd businessman known for his marketing savvy these pastors believe that adopting catchy title sets them apart competitive field says riggins earl professor ethics and theology the interdenominational theological center atlanta who earned doctorate from vanderbilt university order compete reverend not enough for their status says even calling themselves doctors doesn enough have find other titles that have more mystical appeal the embracing popular titles raises some troubling questions though today common for public figures like college football coaches political candidates get caught lying about their qualifications ethical for pastors claim names such bishop doctor though they don meet the traditional qualifications that come with those titles that question touches struggle church leaders have had since jesus disciples were first recorded arguing over who was the greatest says alton pollard director the black church studies program emory university who earned doctorate from duke university are seeking the world validation the same time that struggling honored god pollard says tough balancing act freedom improvise this rush elevated religious titles goes deeper however than the success jakes scholars and preachers say some has with the changing demographics african american congregations african american churches are becoming more middle class and educated turn they expect their pastors share their level education with rapidly growing african american middle class there has been expressed need have the clergy feel they par with their membership pollard says yet members african american churches still rarely question pastors about their credentials the reason due tradition the past african american pastors sometimes assumed titles such doc bishop compensation for being denied access higher education and some within the african american community even with its growing middle class accept that tradition today pollard says many still believe white america fails give black ministers the respect they deserve thus some congregations are sympathetic pastors who may not have the credentials but still demonstrate leadership pollard says this person may not actually have the degrees the world says are important but bestow our own sense importance them says but the trend not confined african american churches spreading through churches that fall outside mainline congregations charismatic megachurches and independent congregations archbishop earl paulk for example the white pastor the cathedral the holy spirit decatur assumed his title through nontraditional means bishop from south america gave him the title said church spokeswoman outside mainline churches pastors also have more room improvise they often don have run for election earn advanced academic credentials assume new title like apostle jamie pleasant they can simply say that god gave them their title pleasant the pastor kingdom builders christian center norcross apostle has traditionally been viewed one the disciples who knew jesus during his earthly ministry paul converted shortly afterward yet pleasant who has marketing from georgia tech but seminary training says apostle literally means one who sent god points the apostle paul example who did not know jesus the flesh pleasant says that like paul was personally appointed jesus says jesus literally appeared him one day laid his hands him and said you are apostle pleasant says doesn feel need attend seminary gets confused about biblical translation uses computer software that translates greek and hebrew his church now has members says say this humbly have very high says doctor another title pastors have been assuming for years creflo dollar the pastor the second largest church metro atlanta world changers church international too was addressed pastor recently two years ago not anymore now calls himself creflo dollar dollar however has never graduated from seminary has bachelor degree education from the state university west georgia earned doctorate religion dollar new title said church spokeswoman comes from another source received honorary degree from oral roberts university henry mitchell atlanta author and one the country leading authorities african american church culture says the practice common mitchell who holds earned doctorates theology and divinity says there are many pastors who call themselves doctor after receiving honorary degree preachers even have nickname for the degrees there are lot donated dignity doctorates says everybody and their brother want have doctorate different definition the title bishop though the most coveted among this new breed pastors but what precisely bishop depends whom you ask mainstream churches bishops are elected appointed church hierarchy the idea person declaring himself herself bishop verges heresy you really implying that you becoming authority unto yourself says earl the interdenominational theological center you were the early church the bishop was appointed the whole thing was affirmed and recognized the community faith you don appoint yourself says yet there another definition bishop that becoming more popular the new breed bishops cite passages the new testament such those the first book timothy where pastor described bishop overseer they say the new testament doesn use the word reverend but bishop bishop eddie long pastor the largest church the metro area the best known converted bishop the area was consecrated bishop the full gospel baptist church fellowship relatively new movement within african american baptist churches that embraces pentecostal beliefs long pastor new birth missionary baptist church lithonia says calls himself bishop because the bible says bishops oversee other pastors well long says offers guidance least other pastors the bishop pastor pastor says someone who recognized for their ability cover other ministries some may ask what important about assuming the title reverend bishop but assuming the title bishop offers distinct advantage for pastor more power reverends traditionally have answer deacon boards other church groups bishops have more autonomy fowler says longer has answer board deacons who would hire and fire will not having any authority over other than the lord with and congregation have the power change whatever need change within the church without having get approved any other person fowler says hodges deacon fowler church says the change his pastor title meant little him don really look names and titles says they don have bearing look the service the man has rendered gospel story some outsiders may question why churches accept pastors changing titles some don churches split some cases members leave the christian tradition however ultimately teaches that those who seek worldly titles elevate themselves are betraying the example jesus earl says one the most famous passages the gospels earl says jesus washes the feet his disciples the night before his execution the foot washing function then performed slaves was used jesus introduce new style leadership was against those who have need lord over people with their titles earl says radically turned
